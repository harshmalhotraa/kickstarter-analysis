# An in-depth Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Overview
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends on campaigns and their outcomes.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to assist Louise in understanding how other campaigns resulted in terms of their campaign launch date and their ambitious goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to figure out exactly how the campaign outcomes resulted, two separate analysis' were conducted. Two different analysis were conducted using two different methods. Pivot tables and Functions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  To generate an analysis based on Launch Date, it was an ideal solution to use pivot tables. Pivot tables   allowed us to visualize data by separating different outcomes with their individual totals. Also, pivot     table allow us to add filters which can furthemore remove unnecessary data. Adding filter to only           showcase theater was important as it was the key area of research for Louise. Pivotchart was also used to   demostrate how the outcomes varied during different times of the year. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  Conducting an analysis in for goals requires various data filterations. This was done by using function     COUNTIFS(). A new sheet was created with various columns where data was again filtered and outcomes were   separated. To generate a visual representation, a line chart was used to showcase how a campaigns goal     had an impact on its outcome. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  One of the few challenges was understanding which data is necessary and how to filter the required data.   In COUNTIFS(), adding a range from two directions was difficult. While the purpose makes sense,             conducting the code and analyzing where to place filters in COUNTIFS() can get challenging.
